## Goal
* Ability to customize CPU information (name, model, vendor, logical/physical core count, etc.)
* Ability to customize GPU information (model, vendor, driver version, etc.)

<img src="showcase.png" alt="Showcase">
Since Incognito changes spoofs how the CPU/GPU is detected, this will work with other mods, e.g., BetterF3.

*Note: This mod requires both [Cloth Config API](<https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config>) and [Mod Menu](<https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu>) to be installed.*

## Why?

Privacy and anonymity! It's as simple as that.
Incognito prevents a single screenshot, clip, live stream, or video from exposing your real computer hardware specifications.
This hardware information is commonly used for [fingerprinting](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint>).
If you value your digital privacy and don't want people tracking you based on your computer hardware, consider giving it a try.
Even if you don't care about the privacy aspect(s), it's still a fun tool to play around with.
